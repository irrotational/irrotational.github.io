I'm a Computational Physicist, recently graduated from the University of Cambridge (PhD, 2025).

My research has primarily focussed on the construction of phase diagrams for materials under extreme pressures and temperatures,
using *ab-initio* techniques (Density Functional Theory) augmented with machine-learned potentials. Once the phase diagram of the
material has been mapped, I'm interested in the electronic structure and electron-phonon properties of those phases, particularly
whether superconductivity is enhanced or suppressed under significant compression.

The majority of my coding work is done in Python, C, C++ and Fortran.
